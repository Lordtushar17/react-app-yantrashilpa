            The strong design-oriented organization known today as Yantrashilpa evolved
            from a solid technical and administrative support base. The origins of its
            engine testing equipment often trace back to the SPMs and test-rigs for ballistic
            applications, designed by the founder in the late 90&apos;s.
            <br /><br />
            Since then Yantrashilpa is one of the leading companies with proven ability to
            deliver innovative products that span traditional and next-generation requirements.
            <br /><br />
            Our customers recognize us for providing remarkably high-quality technology and
            support with expertise to match. Yantrashilpaâ€™s continuing impressive growth is
            a direct result of providing excellent products at appropriate prices and prompt
            delivery in combination with technical support, service, and localized inventory.
